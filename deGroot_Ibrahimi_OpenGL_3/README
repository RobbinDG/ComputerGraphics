The changes we made are the following:

Common animation:
 - We implemented a simple scene matching all requirements. Movement is possible using WASD + up and down arrows.
 - The code has been transformed to be reusable and properly object oriented for easy scene construction. Animations can be reused for multiple objects (not done in this scene)
 - We implemented 2 animation classes, but more can easily be created. An animation can be paired with a drawable object in order to animate it easily.

Advanced vertex manipulation:
 - We implemented everything that was explained in the assignment. Luckily, we did not encounter any issues with this sub-assignment as everything went fairly smoothly.
 - Moreover, it was unclear whether the implementation for Gouraud shading and Normal mapping should be implemented, so we left it as is given the template code.
 - We disabled the ability to load textures onto the mesh as it was not necessary for this part of the assignment. We left all the code in though in case it is ever needed, but simply commented it out.
 - Similarly, we also left the original code in for the fragment shader to show what we used.
 - We included images in the Screenshot folder for every part of this sub-assignment.
   For 3.1.png we used the following settings:
    - Amplitude = 0.4
    - Frequency = 4.8
    - Time = 1
    - Phi = 0

Suggestions:
It was a bit unclear from the assignment and TA interaction whether a light source should stay fixed, or get transformed along with the object(s). Maybe this could be improved next year. Moreover, the template code had a GUI bug that resulted in strange controls on machines running macOS. A TA luckily helped me solve this fairly quickly, but it would be nice if this could be fixed from the beginning to prevent confusion. Overall it was a very nice and clear assignment, well done!
