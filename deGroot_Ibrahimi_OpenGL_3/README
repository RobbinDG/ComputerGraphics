The changes we made are the following:

Common animation:


Advanced vertex manipulation:
 - We implemented everything that was explained in the assignment. Luckily, we did not encounter any issues with this sub-assignment as everything went fairly smoothly.
 - We included images in the Screenshot folder for every part of this sub-assignment.
   For 3.1.png we used the following settings:
    - Amplitude = 0.4
    - Frequency = 4.8
    - Time = 1
    - Phi = 0

Suggestions:
It was a bit unclear from the assignment and TA interaction whether a light source should stay fixed, or get transformed along with the object(s). Maybe this could be improved next year. Moreover, the template code had a GUI bug that resulted in strange controls on machines running macOS. A TA luckily helped me solve this fairly quickly, but it would be nice if this could be fixed from the beginning to prevent confusion. Overall it was a very nice and clear assignment, well done!
