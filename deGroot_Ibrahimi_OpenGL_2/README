Assignment OpenGL 2 - de Groot, Robbin; Ibrahimi, Erblin.

List of modifications:
 - We implemented Phong/Normal/Gouraud shading, and made separate fragment- and vertex shaders for both
 - We added the ability to be able to switch between these shaders in the UI
 - We added the ability to be able to load .png textures onto the meshes

User instructions:
 - The rotating buttons at the top rotate all elements around their axes in the x, y and z direction. You can reset the rotation with the "reset rotation" button.
 - Similarly, one may scale all objects by using the scale slider. This also can be reset with the appropriate button.
 - Under the "Shading" section you can now choose which shader you would like to see/apply

Difficulties:
 - We initially tried to multiply the texture color with the appropriate Phong illumination model components in the vertex shader, which led to undesired results. We ended up fixing this by passing the Ia, Id and Is to the fragment shader and multiplying the texture colours there
 - We could not get unitize to work in time, so there is some leftover code in there

Assignment questions:
 - When rendering the mesh without the normal matrix applied, it shows the uniform colours independent of transformations. When applying the normal matrix, on the other hand, the normals are relative to the transformations.
